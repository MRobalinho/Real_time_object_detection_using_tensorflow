<br/>Pre-trained models Tensorflow detection model zoo- COCO Dataset provide a collection of detection models pre-trained on the COCO dataset. 
<br/>These models can be useful for out-of-the-box inference if you are interested in categories already 
in COCO (e.g., humans, cars, etc). They are also useful for initializing your models when training on novel datasets.
